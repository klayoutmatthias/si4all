A fake "technology" to play with. 

This is in preparation of the talk at FSiC2019 (https://wiki.f-si.org/index.php/FSiC2019).

DISLAIMER: The technology described in this project is 
entirely fake. All numbers given are just guesses. Any similarity
to a real technology is just coincidence.

Here is a rough table of contents:

* "Design manual": dm.pdf
* XSection file: process.xs and xs.lyp (for display)
* DRC: drc/drc.lydrc
* A test layout for DRC: drc_errors.gds
* A test layout with some devices: devices.gds
